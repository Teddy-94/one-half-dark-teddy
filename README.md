This is a theme designed for the Helix editor using the same colors as the One Half theme.

To use the original One Half Theme, see [sonph/onehalf](https://github.com/sonph/onehalf)

For more information about the Helix editor, see the [Helix Editor website](https://helix-editor.com/)

## How to use:
1. Put the `one-half-teddy.toml` file in your `./config/helix/themes` folder.
2. Set the theme to "one-half-teddy" like this: <br/>
`theme = "one-half-teddy"`<br/>
Alternatively, you can run `:theme one-half-teddy` from a Helix buffer to set the theme until next launch.

This theme uses nice colors, so `true-color = true` needs to be set in the `[editor]` section in your config.

Feel free to copy, remix, and get inspired by this theme, and don\'t forget to visit the original theme linked above!
