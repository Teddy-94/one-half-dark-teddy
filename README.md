# One Half Teddy
This is a theme designed for the Helix editor using the same colors as the One Half theme.

To use the original One Half Theme, see [sonph/onehalf](https://github.com/sonph/onehalf)

For more information about the Helix editor, see the [Helix Editor website](https://helix-editor.com/)

## How to use:
1. Put the .toml file in the ./config/helix/theme folder.
2. Set the \[theme\] to "one-half-teddy" like this:
`theme = "one-half-teddy"`
Alternatively, you can run `:theme one-half-teddy` from a Helix buffer to set the theme until next launch.

this theme uses nice colors, so `true-color = true` needs to be set in the `[editor]` section in your config.

Feel free to copy, remix, and get inspired by this theme!
